This directory contains Lean files that define the following main topics, although some proofs are missing:
1. Relative inverses of commutative semigroups, 
2. Bolean algebras from the idempotent elements in commutative rings,
3. Every Boolean algebra over a field has either a finite set of atoms whoos supremum is the top or a strictly increasing sequence.
4. Ideals generated by a co-atom are maximal.
5. Ideals that are generated by an atom are isomorphic to fields.
6. A finite dimensional commutative unital algebra over a field has a finite set of atoms whos sup is the top element. 
7. This implies that a finite dimensional commutative unital algebra over a field is isomorphic to the unique direct product of ideals generated by the atoms.
8. All elements in an algebraic separable commutative unital algebra over a field have relative inverses.
